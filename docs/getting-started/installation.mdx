# Installation

## Requirements
Here're the system requirements for MS-AMP.
* Latest version of Linux, you're highly encouraged to use Ubuntu 18.04 or later.
* Nvidia GPU(e.g. H100/A100) and compatible drivers should be installed correctly.
*  Driver version can be checked by running `nvidia-smi`.
* Python version 3.7 or later (which can be checked by running `python3 --version`).
* Pip version 18.0 or later (which can be checked by running `python3 -m pip --version`).
* CUDA version 11 or later (which can be checked by running `nvcc --version`).
* PyTorch version 1.14 or later (which can be checked by running `python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"`).

You can try MS-AMP in two ways: Using Docker or installing from source:  

* Using Docker is a convenient way to get started with MS-AMP. You can use the pre-built Docker image to quickly set up an environment for running MS-AMP.  
* On the other hand, installing from source gives you more control over the installation process and allows you to customize the installation to your needs.

## Use Docker

You can try the latest MS-AMP Docker container with the following commands:

```bash
sudo docker run -it -d --name=msampcu121 --privileged --net=host --ipc=host --gpus=all -v /:/hostroot ghcr.io/azure/msamp:main-cuda12.1 bash
sudo docker exec -it msampcu121 bash
```

MS-AMP is pre-installed in Docker container and you can verify it by running:

```bash
python -c 'import msamp;print(msamp.__version__)'
```

We also provide stable Docker images [here](../user-tutorial/container-images.mdx). 

## Install from source

We strongly recommend using [PyTorch NGC Container](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/pytorch) to avoid messing up local environment.  
For example, to start PyTorch 2.1 container, run the following command:

```bash
sudo docker run -it -d --name=msamp --privileged --net=host --ipc=host --gpus=all nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:23.04-py3 bash
sudo docker exec -it msamp bash
```

Then, you can clone the source from GitHub.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure/MS-AMP.git
cd MS-AMP
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

If you want to train model with multiple GPU, you need to install MSCCL to support FP8. Please note that the compilation of MSCCL may take ~40 minutes on A100 nodes and ~7 minutes on H100 node.

```bash
cd third_party/msccl

# A100
make -j src.build NVCC_GENCODE="-gencode=arch=compute_80,code=sm_80"
# H100
make -j src.build NVCC_GENCODE="-gencode=arch=compute_90,code=sm_90"

apt-get update
apt install build-essential devscripts debhelper fakeroot
make pkg.debian.build
dpkg -i build/pkg/deb/libnccl2_*.deb
dpkg -i build/pkg/deb/libnccl-dev_2*.deb

cd -
```

Then, you can install MS-AMP from source.

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install .
make postinstall
```

Before using MS-AMP, you need to preload msampfp8 library and it's depdencies:

```bash
NCCL_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnccl.so # Change as needed
export LD_PRELOAD="/usr/local/lib/libmsamp_dist.so:${NCCL_LIBRARY}:${LD_PRELOAD}"
```

After that, you can verify the installation by running:

```bash
python3 -c "import msamp; print(msamp.__version__)"
```

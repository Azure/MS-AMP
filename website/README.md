# MS-AMP Website

MS-AMP website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```bash
cd website
npm install
npm start
```

It will start a local development server and opens up a browser window.
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
